I want to share a recent project where I developed an interactive Excel dashboard for an e-Commerce platform. The goal was to analyze and visualize data to uncover valuable insights and trends.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Highlights:
Data Cleaning: The first step was to clean and prepare the raw data. I removed duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured data consistency to set a solid foundation.

Pivot Tables & Slicers: To create dynamic and insightful reports, I utilized pivot tables and slicers. This allowed me to summarize large datasets and quickly filter and drill down into specific segments.

Interactive Dashboard: The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing. I incorporated charts, conditional formatting to provide a comprehensive view of the data.

Key Insights: The dashboard revealed critical metrics such as sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. These insights are now driving data-informed decisions and strategic planning.

üîç Results:
Increased data visibility and accessibility.
Enhanced decision-making with real-time insights.
Streamlined reporting process, saving valuable time.
